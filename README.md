# OGLdev tutorials in Rust

[OGLdev](http://ogldev.atspace.co.uk/) is a very nice tutorial that introduces basic knowledge for writing a OpenGL program. The original tutorial is based on C. However, I want to reproduce the same results in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for fun and learning. So that is why I created this repository.
